== aeropressTimer (soon to be coffeeFilter.me)

This is a simple Rails application to record any of your coffee recipes (and hopefully time them with the built in countdown feature). I promise to update with a proper README soon, just getting my head around the concepts and hope that they are of use to somebody.
